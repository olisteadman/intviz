# Interactive visualizations in Python

View the interactive notebook [here](https://notebooks.azure.com/olisteadman/projects/2018-data-access).

*(Thanks must go to Azure Notebooks, an incredible hosted service for [Jupyter Notebooks](#jupyter) that required no installation! It enabled me to get started quickly on prototyping this project/idea, and allows you the viewer to combine explicit **code insight** with **tactile interactive widgets**, all in a single browser page. Try Azure Notebooks for yourself, and you'll find you're hosting your precious .ipynb files in about thirty seconds flat! Azure 1, GCP 0, AWS 0)*

This project sets out to create a hands-on learning resource (aimed at everybody from budding Data Scientists to visual artists with a flair for code), to demonstrate specific arguments can be introduced into some of the most popular Python visualization commands, to produce the best plots. By simply running the cells in the notebook, you should be able to see the hard-coded version of each plot **and then make adjustments** using the interactive sliders & inputs provided by **ipywidgets**: 
- interact,
- interactive, 
- fixed, 
- interact_manual, 
- SelectionSlider,

... more will be added. Please join the discussion at https://github.com/olisteadman/intviz.git.
