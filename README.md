# Interactive visualizations in Python

*(Big thanks to Azure Notebooks, this incredible hosted service for [Jupyter Notebooks](#jupyter) that required no installation! It enabled me to get started quickly on prototyping this project/idea, and allows you the viewer to combine **code insight** with tactile interactive widgets, all in one browser page. Try it out yourself and you'll find you're hosting your precious .ipynb files in about thirty seconds flat! Azure 1, GCP 0, AWS 0)*

This project sets out to explain, to everybody from budding Data Scientists to visual artists with a flair for code, what specific arguments can be introduced into a Python visualization command for the best kind of plots to be shown. You can see below the hard-coded version of each plot ***and then adjust*** using interactive sliders & inputs provided by ipywidgets: 
- interact,
- interactive, 
- fixed, 
- interact_manual, 
- and SelectionSlider

More will be added as time goes by. Please join the discussion at https://github.com/olisteadman/intviz.git.
